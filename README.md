# Gaglione et al. 2025

Compilation of code used to generate overhangs for TCRAFT as well as scripting pipelines designed for sequencing analysis/validation of TCRAFT-assembled TCR libraries.

Contains the following directories:
- **Nanopore_Scripts**: Scripts and reference parameters/data used to analyze long-read Nanopore sequencing data collected from the TCRAFT libraries.
- **Short_Read_Scripts**: Scripts and reference parameters/data used to analyze short-read sequencing for the amplified CDR3 regions of the assembled TCRs as well as the original CDR3 oligo pools.
- **Vector_Pool_Scripts**: Scripts that were used to analyze sequencing data from the TRBV-TRAC and TRBC-TRAV vector pools to confirm vector pool quality/uniformity.
- **Overhang_Generation**: Jupyter Notebooks that contain the MCMC sampling pipeline which was originally used to generate overhang sets for the TCRAFT vector pools.
